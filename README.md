# full-stack-tinyurl

## Develop a full stack web app using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js) to deliver TinyURL- like URL shortening service with a REST API backend.  
## Use Redis as cache layer over MongoDB to improve the server performance and Dockerize the server app so we can scale up the server to multiple instances.  
## Deploy server containers under Nginx, gaining load balancing and reverse proxy features.  
## After the service has accumulated TBs of application data and logs, migrate from MongoDB to Apache Cassandra to create a distributed data store.
